Varnish object size request histogram

SYNOPSIS
========

varnishsizes [-b] [-C] [-c] [-d] [-I regex] [-i tag] [-m tag:regex ...]
	     [-n varnish_name] [-r file] [-V] [-w delay] [-X regex] [-x tag]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The varnishsizes utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and presents
a continuously updated histogram showing the distribution of the last N
requests by their processing.  The value of N and the vertical scale are
displayed in the top left corner.  The horizontal scale is a logarithmic
representation of bytes.  Hits are marked with a pipe character
("|"), and misses are marked with a hash character ("#").

The following options are available:

-b          Include log entries which result from communication with a backend server.  
	    If neither -b nor -c is specified, varnishsizes acts as if they both were.

-C          Ignore case when matching regular expressions.

-c          Include log entries which result from communication with a client.  
	    If neither -b nor -c is specified, varnishsizes acts as if they both were.

-d          Process old log entries on startup.  Normally, varnishsizes will only 
	    process entries which are written to the log after it starts.

-I regex    Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.  
   	    If neither -I nor -i is specified, all log entries are included.

-i tag      Include log entries with the specified tag.  If neither -I nor -i 
   	    is specified, all log entries are included.

-m tag:regex only list record where tag matches regex. Multiple -m
             options are AND-ed together.

-n          Specifies the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from.  
	    If -n is not specified, the host name is used.

-r file     Read log entries from file instead of shared memory.

-V          Display the version number and exit.

-w delay    Wait at least delay seconds between each update.  The default is 1.  
   	    file instead of displaying them.  The file will be overwritten 
	    unless the -a option was specified.

-X regex    Exclude log entries which match the specified regular expression.

-x tag      Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
