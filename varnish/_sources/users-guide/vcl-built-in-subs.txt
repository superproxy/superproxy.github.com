Built in subroutines
--------------------


vcl_recv
~~~~~~~~

Called at the beginning of a request, after the complete request has
been received and parsed. Its purpose is to decide whether or not to
serve the request, how to do it, and, if applicable, which backend to
use.

It is also used to modify the request, something you'll probably find
yourself doing frequently. 

The `vcl_recv` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` on one
of the following keywords:

  synth(status code, reason)
    Return a synthetic object with the specified status code to the
    client and abandon the request.

  pass
    Switch to pass mode. Control will eventually pass to vcl_pass.

  pipe
    Switch to pipe mode. Control will eventually pass to vcl_pipe.

  hash
    Continue processing the object as a potential candidate for
    caching. Passes the control over to vcl_hash.

  purge
    Purge the object and it's variants. Control passes through 
    vcl_hash to vcl_purge.

vcl_pipe
~~~~~~~~

Called upon entering pipe mode. In this mode, the request is passed
on to the backend, and any further data from either client or backend
is passed on unaltered until either end closes the
connection. Basically, Varnish will degrade into a simple TCP proxy,
shuffling bytes back and forth.

The `vcl_pipe` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  synth(status code, reason)
    Return the specified status code to the client and abandon the request.

  pipe
    Proceed with pipe mode.

vcl_pass
~~~~~~~~

Called upon entering pass mode. In this mode, the request is passed
on to the backend, and the backend's response is passed on to the
client, but is not entered into the cache. Subsequent requests
submitted over the same client connection are handled normally.

The `vcl_pass` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  synth(status code, reason)
    Return the specified status code to the client and abandon the request.

  pass
    Proceed with pass mode.

  restart
    Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number
    of restarts is higher than *max_restarts* Varnish emits a guru meditation
    error.


vcl_hit
~~~~~~~

Called when a cache lookup is successful. 

The `vcl_hit` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one of the following keywords:


  restart
    Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number
    of restarts is higher than *max_restarts* Varnish emits a guru meditation
    error.

  deliver
    Deliver the object. Control passes to `vcl_deliver`.

  synth(status code, reason)
    Return the specified status code to the client and abandon the request.


vcl_miss
~~~~~~~~

Called after a cache lookup if the requested document was not found in
the cache. Its purpose is to decide whether or not to attempt to
retrieve the document from the backend, and which backend to use.

The `vcl_miss` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  synth(status code, reason)
    Return the specified status code to the client and abandon the request.

  pass
    Switch to pass mode. Control will eventually pass to `vcl_pass`.

  fetch
    Retrieve the requested object from the backend. Control will
    eventually pass to `vcl_backend_fetch`.

  restart
    Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number
    of restarts is higher than *max_restarts* Varnish emits a guru meditation
    error.


vcl_hash
~~~~~~~~

Called after `vcl_recv` to create a hash value for the request. This is
used as a key to look up the object in Varnish.

The `vcl_hash` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  lookup
    Look up the object in cache. Control passes to vcl_miss, vcl_hit
    or vcl_purge.


vcl_purge
~~~~~~~~~

Called after the purge has been executed and all its variants have been evited.

The `vcl_purge` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  synth
    Produce a response.

  restart
    Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number
    of restarts is higher than *max_restarts* Varnish emits a guru meditation
    error.


vcl_deliver
~~~~~~~~~~~

Called before a cached object is delivered to the client.

The `vcl_deliver` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

  deliver
    Deliver the object to the client.

  restart
    Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number
    of restarts is higher than *max_restarts* Varnish emits a guru meditation
    error.


vcl_backend_fetch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called before sending the backend request. In this subroutine you
typically alter the request before it gets to the backend.

The `vcl_backend_fetch` subroutine may terminate with calling
``return()`` with one of the following keywords:

  fetch
    Fetch the object from the backend.

  abandon
    Abandon the backend request and generates an error.


vcl_backend_response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called after the response headers has been successfully retrieved from
the backend.

The `vcl_backend_response` subroutine may terminate with calling
``return()`` with one of the following keywords:

  deliver
    Possibly insert the object into the cache, then deliver it to the
    Control will eventually pass to `vcl_deliver`.

  abandon
    Abandon the backend request and generates an error.

  retry
    Retry the backend transaction. Increases the `retries` counter.
    If the number of retries is higher than *max_retries* Varnish
    emits a guru meditation error.

vcl_backend_error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subroutine is called if we fail the backend fetch. 

The `vcl_backend_error` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()``
with one of the following keywords:

  deliver
    Deliver the error.

  retry
    Retry the backend transaction. Increases the `retries` counter. If
    the number of retries is higher than *max_retries* Varnish emits a
    guru meditation error.


vcl_init
~~~~~~~~

Called when VCL is loaded, before any requests pass through it.
Typically used to initialize VMODs.

The `vcl_init` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()``
with one of the following keywords:

  ok
    Normal return, VCL continues loading.


vcl_fini
~~~~~~~~

Called when VCL is discarded only after all requests have exited the VCL.
Typically used to clean up VMODs.

The `vcl_fini` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()``
with one of the following keywords:

  ok
    Normal return, VCL will be discarded.
